	<h1>Project Management</h1>
	<div class="center">
	<p>The reason that I'm making a career out of technology is because it's something that I love to do. Part of the goal of a career in IT is to be a project manager and to be able to overlook the scope of a project. I think that being able to understand the technical portion of a project is a must when it comes to managing that project, so my goal is to get the experience in order to work up to that.</p>
	<h1>IT Consultant</h1>
	<p>I plan to be a consultant during my time as an IT professional. I want to be able to run my own business and help the companies that I personally choose to help. To be in control of that is one of the main things that I look forward to. Though I love working for other companies, I think I would enjoy running my own just as much.</p>
	<h1>Business Owner</h1>
	<p>I would love to be able to turn my career into a bigger goal by making my own business out of it. This, coupled with being a Consultant, would be the perfect idea of a career for me. To be able to control my business and its employees and guide them in the right direction is something that I hope to achieve someday.</p>
