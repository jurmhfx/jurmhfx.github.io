	<p>For as long as I can remember, I've had a passion for working around computers. As a kid, I'd take them apart and put them back together. As an adult, I built them for friends and coworkers.
	Through all of the experimentation, I've learned many different skills and different was to apply them.</p>
	<p>Some examples of skills I've learned are:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>When speaking, able to use wording depending on their level of expertise (developers, users, clients)</li>
	<li>Able to work well in a team environment or individually</li>
	<li>Microsoft Office proficiency (excel, word, access)</li>
	<li>Command line interface on Linux/Windows, powershell on Windows</li>
	<li>Virtualization, docker and containerization</li>
	<li>Microsoft Exchange Server/O365 integration and cloud migration</li>
	<li>Understanding of various programming languages (Java, Python, HTML, CSS, VBScript)</li>
	</ul>
